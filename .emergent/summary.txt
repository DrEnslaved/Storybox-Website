The AI engineer continued development on a Bulgarian business website, focusing on a significant platform shift and feature enhancements. The main work involved integrating Medusa as the new e-commerce backend. This necessitated installing and configuring PostgreSQL and Redis, setting up the Medusa server, handling database migrations, and seeding initial products and regions. A key challenge was managing Medusa's publishable API keys and ensuring the Next.js frontend communicated correctly with Medusa, leading to a refactor of API routes into separate, cleaner files. Post-integration, the AI addressed critical UI/UX bugs: a broken cart page, incorrect pricing tier visibility, and a non-functional profile dropdown. Further, new features like order annulment and clickable profile navigation were implemented. Finally, extensive branding and contact information updates were applied across the application, and comprehensive documentation was generated, concluding with the start of a project roadmap.

The user requested a fast, modern, professional Bulgarian business website (STORVBOX, later Storybox) for embroidery and print design services.
**Phase 1 (Implemented previously):** Next.js (TypeScript) + Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui frontend, Sanity CMS (yhhlq588, sbxdataset) for service, project, about, blog content, and MongoDB for contact/quote forms. Branding was green/white (#90B000), with accessibility and SEO for Sofia, Bulgaria.
**Phase 2 (Implemented previously):** E-commerce flow (product listing/details, cart, checkout, order management), JWT + Google authentication, B2B features (customer accounts, price tiers, bulk orders, MOQ), sample product seeding, and cookie consent.
**Current Development Requests (Implemented in trajectory):**
-   **Medusa Integration:** Replace/integrate with Medusa for full commerce backend.
-   **Order Annulment:** Add functionality to cancel completed orders.
-   **Profile Navigation:** Make the profile name in the header clickable to navigate to My Profile.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary, the AI engineer successfully implemented all user-requested changes, including the complex Medusa integration, various bug fixes across e-commerce pages, new features like order annulment and clickable profile links, and comprehensive branding updates. The final task in the trajectory was to generate full documentation, which has been completed by creating , , and several files in the  directory. The very last action was the user providing a detailed To do list for future enhancements. The AI's response was to create a comprehensive roadmap document based on this list, organizing and prioritizing the items. This means the AI is currently in the process of structuring and possibly augmenting the user's future development plan.
