The AI engineer's work in this trajectory primarily focused on robustifying the application's local development setup and integrating Sanity CMS for blogging functionality. Key initial efforts involved creating comprehensive, interactive setup scripts for both Bash and Windows environments, alongside detailed documentation. Significant time was dedicated to debugging Windows batch script syntax, resolving dependency issues (), and tackling critical Next.js memory allocation failures (increasing  heap size). Following this, Sanity CMS was integrated, encompassing client configuration, schema definition, blog page and component development. After successfully seeding sample blog posts despite initial permission errors, the AI meticulously adapted the blog's UI/UX to align with the existing site design, ensuring visual consistency. The trajectory concluded with preparing documentation for the upcoming Medusa integration.

<product_requirements>
The project's core objective is to build a modern Bulgarian e-commerce site for Storybox using Next.js, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui, and MongoDB. It features JWT/Google authentication, B2B functionalities, and cookie consent.

**Implemented features during this trajectory:**
-   **Comprehensive Setup:** Interactive local development, quick start, and production deployment scripts for Bash and Windows.
-   **Documentation:** , , , , , , .
-   **Sanity CMS Integration:**
    -   Configuration of Sanity client, schemas (author, category, post, block content).
    -   Creation of dedicated blog pages (, ) and components (, ).
    -   Ability to seed sample blog posts programmatically.
    -   Successful display of blog posts from Sanity.
    -   Matching the blog's UI/UX to the existing website's aesthetic, including card layouts and hero sections.
</product_requirements>

<key_technical_concepts>
-   **Frontend:** Next.js, React (TypeScript), Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui.
-   **CMS:** Sanity CMS.
-   **Backend/APIs:** Next.js API routes, MongoDB.
-   **State/Context:** React Context (SimpleCartContext).
-   **Error Tracking:** Sentry.
-   **Testing:** Jest, Playwright.
-   **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions.
-   **DevOps:** Bash scripting, Windows Batch scripting, .
-   **Libraries:**  (for Sanity UI).
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The application employs a Next.js full-stack architecture with file-system-based routing. MongoDB is the primary data store. The  e-commerce backend is present but inactive, utilizing a -based  for cart functionality. Sanity CMS has been integrated for content management.

**Key File Summaries and Changes:**
-   ****: Crucial for dependency management and scripts. Updated to include  (for Windows compatibility), Sanity-related packages (, , ),  (required by Sanity UI), and scripts for running Sanity Studio. The  environment variable for  was also increased from 512MB to 2048MB to mitigate out-of-memory errors.
-   ****: Stores environment configurations. Updated to include , , , and  to connect to the Sanity CMS instance.
-   ** & **: Windows batch scripts for local development. These were extensively debugged and modified to fix syntax errors (e.g., BASH=/bin/bash

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer successfully integrated Sanity CMS into the Storybox application. This involved creating all necessary Sanity configuration files, schemas (for author, category, post), and API client utilities in the  and  directories. New frontend blog pages ( and ) and reusable components (, ) were developed to display content from Sanity.

The work also included extensive debugging:
1.  **Setup Scripts:** Created and debugged interactive Bash and Windows batch scripts (, , ) to handle local development, quick start, and production setup, including dependency checks and environment configuration. This involved fixing several Windows batch syntax errors and adding  to resolve  issues.
2.  **Sanity Configuration:** Updated  with provided Sanity , , and API tokens.
3.  **Memory Issues:** Resolved persistent Next.js out-of-memory errors by increasing  in  from 512MB to 2048MB.
4.  **Dependency Fix:** Installed  to resolve a build error related to Sanity UI.
5.  **Content Seeding:** Developed  and, after resolving syntax errors and obtaining a Sanity API token with write permissions, successfully populated the blog with 5 sample posts and an author.
6.  **UI/UX Alignment:** Modified the blog listing page and individual post pages, along with , to adopt the existing visual design language observed on the homepage and shop pages (e.g., card styles, hero section aesthetics).

The very last actions involved creating documentation (, ) to summarize the completed work and outline preparations for the next phase of Medusa integration.
