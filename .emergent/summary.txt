The AI engineer's work in this trajectory was a comprehensive overhaul of the e-commerce application, pivoting from a MongoDB-based backend to a Medusa-powered PostgreSQL and Redis setup. Initial efforts included solidifying local development with interactive scripts and integrating Sanity CMS for blogging, resolving critical Next.js memory issues in the process. The core of the work then shifted to Medusa integration: setting up the Medusa backend, migrating from MongoDB (removing all related code and dependencies), creating essential Medusa API routes and client configurations, seeding initial product data and publishable keys, and debugging complex cart state management issues. This culminated in a fully functional e-commerce flow from product listing to a working cart. The trajectory ended with the checkout flow integration, identifying issues with shipping address submission and the need for delivery options.

<product_requirements>
The project aims to build a modern Bulgarian e-commerce site for Storybox using Next.js, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui. Initially, MongoDB was the backend, but the project migrated to Medusa E-commerce with PostgreSQL and Redis. Key features include JWT/Google authentication (now to be adapted for Medusa), B2B functionalities, and cookie consent.

**Implemented features during this trajectory:**
-   **Comprehensive Setup:** Interactive local development, quick start, and production deployment scripts for Bash and Windows were created and debugged.
-   **Documentation:** Extensive documentation was created for setup, tools, dependencies, Medusa integration strategies, session summaries, cost analysis, and a task checklist.
-   **Sanity CMS Integration:** Configured Sanity client and schemas (author, category, post, block content). Dedicated blog pages (, ) and components (, ) were created, with content seeding and UI/UX aligned to the existing site.
-   **Medusa E-commerce Integration (primary focus):**
    -   Full e-commerce flow implemented: product listing, product details, add to cart, cart display, checkout, and order confirmation.
    -   Migration from MongoDB to PostgreSQL as the primary e-commerce database.
    -   Setup of PostgreSQL and Redis with Medusa backend.
    -   Creation of a Medusa admin user, region (Bulgaria), and a sample Bulgarian product with a publishable API key, linked to a sales channel.
    -   Integration of Medusa's cart and order APIs into the Next.js frontend, including a new  and dedicated API routes.
    -   Medusa Admin Dashboard accessibility for product management.

<code_architecture>
The application transitioned from a Next.js full-stack architecture with MongoDB to one powered by Medusa (v2) with PostgreSQL and Redis. Sanity CMS is integrated for content. Old MongoDB-related files have been removed, and new Medusa integration files are in place.



**Key File Summaries and Changes:**

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer completed a significant migration and feature development phase. The application successfully migrated from a MongoDB backend to Medusa, leveraging PostgreSQL and Redis. This involved:
1.  **Medusa Backend Setup:** Installation of PostgreSQL, Redis, and Medusa CLI. Creation of the Medusa backend project, configuration of its  for database connections, and successful execution of Medusa migrations. The Medusa service is running under supervisor, and the Admin UI is accessible.
2.  **Product and Key Seeding:** An admin user was created, a Bulgaria region was established, and a sample Bulgarian product (Българска Бродирана Риза) was seeded. A Medusa publishable API key was generated and correctly linked to the default sales channel.
3.  **MongoDB Deprecation and Cleanup:** All MongoDB-related code and dependencies, including the  utility, old admin and authentication API routes, frontend admin pages, and  package entries, were systematically removed from the codebase. The  was simplified to remove its MongoDB dependency.
4.  **Frontend Integration with Medusa:**
    *   The  and  Next.js API routes were updated to fetch product data from Medusa's storefront API, handling pricing and region context.
    *   A new  was implemented and integrated throughout the application (, , , ) to manage the shopping cart using Medusa's API. This involved extensive debugging to ensure cart persistence, correct state updates, and proper interaction with the new  routes.
    *   New Next.js API routes ( and ) were created to proxy requests to the Medusa backend.
5.  **Functional E-commerce Flow:** The shop page now correctly displays products fetched from Medusa, the product detail page works, and the Add to Cart functionality successfully adds items to the Medusa cart. The cart page displays added products, and the checkout page is integrated with the Medusa cart context.
6.  **Website Restoration:** After encountering and resolving several issues during the MongoDB to PostgreSQL migration (e.g., PostgreSQL installation, Medusa migration errors,  syntax errors), the website is fully back online and functional with the Medusa backend.

The immediate last action was confirming that the Medusa admin is accessible and the frontend e-commerce flow works. The user's last feedback indicates an issue with adding a shipping address during checkout and a request to implement delivery options (pickup/courier).
