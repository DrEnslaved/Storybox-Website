The AI engineer's work began with a previously implemented Medusa e-commerce integration, which faced initial setup and runtime issues. The primary focus evolved through several phases: first, resolving critical server configuration problems related to PostgreSQL and Redis which prevented the Next.js frontend from running. A key decision was to temporarily disable Medusa and its dependencies to unblock frontend development. The engineer then systematically addressed UI/UX mobile responsiveness, integrated Sentry for error tracking, established a comprehensive testing suite (Jest for unit, Playwright for E2E), and set up a CI/CD pipeline. Further, performance, accessibility (WCAG), and security (OWASP) audits were conducted with corresponding improvements. A major turning point was when the user reported cart issues, leading to the development of a -based fallback cart due to the persistent Medusa backend issues. Subsequently, Google Analytics and Mixpanel were integrated. The most recent and significant phase involved building a secure admin panel for managing users, products, orders, projects, and blogs, including features like admin login, user management, order management (with annulment), and product inventory (with SKU). The work concluded with a final summary being generated after implementing admin product features.

The project aims to build a fast, modern, professional Bulgarian business website for Storybox (formerly STORVBOX) offering embroidery and print design services. The initial phases involved a Next.js (TypeScript) + Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui frontend, Sanity CMS for content, MongoDB for forms, green/white branding, and basic e-commerce with JWT/Google auth, B2B features, sample products, and cookie consent.

**Recent Development (covered in trajectory):**
- **Medusa Integration:** (Initially done by previous AI, but backend services were not stable)
- **UI/UX Responsiveness:** Improve mobile and tablet display.
- **Sentry Error Tracking:** Implement real-time error monitoring.
- **Testing Suite:** Introduce unit (Jest) and E2E (Playwright) testing for critical flows.
- **CI/CD Pipeline:** Automate testing and deployment with GitHub Actions.
- **Performance Audit:** Optimize application performance.
- **WCAG Compliance:** Implement accessibility improvements.
- **OWASP Security Checklist:** Enhance application security.
- **Analytics Integration:** Integrate Google Analytics and Mixpanel with tracking.
- **Admin Panel:** Create a secure admin interface for managing users, products, orders, projects, and blog.
- **Admin Order Annulment:** Add functionality for admins to cancel orders.
- **Admin Product Inventory:** Implement a product management system with SKU tracking for admins.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was focused on enhancing the admin panel's capabilities. Specifically, the user requested adding order annulment functionality for administrators and an inventory management system for products, including SKU tracking. The AI successfully implemented an API endpoint for admin order annulment () and updated the admin orders page () to include an annul button. Following this, new API endpoints for admin product management were created ( and ). A dedicated UI page for product management () was also generated. The final action recorded was updating the main admin dashboard () to include a link to the new products page, including a fix for a missing import. The AI was in the process of generating a comprehensive summary of these latest admin features. The Medusa backend, PostgreSQL, and Redis remain disabled, with the application currently relying on a -based cart fallback for storefront e-commerce functionality.
