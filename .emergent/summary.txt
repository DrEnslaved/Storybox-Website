The AI engineer successfully guided the user through the initial setup and two major development phases for a Bulgarian business website. Phase 1 focused on a responsive Next.js frontend with Sanity CMS integration for service showcases, project galleries, blog, and contact/quote forms. The AI clarified requirements, set up Sanity, fetched images, and implemented all core content pages, including a working contact form. Phase 2 shifted to e-commerce, authentication (JWT + Google OAuth), product catalog, cart, checkout, and account management. The AI iteratively built features, addressed layout issues, updated the branding color, implemented responsiveness, SEO, and cookie consent, and successfully seeded a sample product. The codebase was also pushed to a user-provided GitHub repository. The AI demonstrated iterative development, robust debugging, and clear communication, always seeking user input for critical decisions.
