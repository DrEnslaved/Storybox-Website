The previous AI engineerâ€™s work has largely focused on maturing a Next.js e-commerce application from an MVP state, addressing critical issues and expanding core functionalities. Initially, the project struggled with a dormant Medusa backend and fundamental setup problems, leading to a pivot to a -based cart. The trajectory then details a systematic effort to enhance UI responsiveness, integrate vital services like Sentry and analytics (GA, Mixpanel), and establish a robust development workflow through comprehensive testing (Jest, Playwright) and CI/CD. A significant portion of the work involved building a secure admin panel for product, order, and user management, which was iteratively improved with detailed product fields, backorder handling, dynamic shop filtering, and accurate dashboard statistics. UI/UX glitches, such as hydration errors and overlapping components, were meticulously resolved, showcasing a strong focus on stability and user experience. The latest efforts were directed towards consolidating documentation and preparing for pre-release.

The project aims to develop a performant, modern, and professional Bulgarian e-commerce website for Storybox, offering embroidery and print design services. The foundational application was built with Next.js (TypeScript), Tailwind CSS, and shadcn/ui, using Sanity CMS for content and MongoDB for forms. Key branding includes green/white colors, basic e-commerce functionality with JWT/Google authentication, B2B features, and cookie consent.

**Implemented features and requirements during this trajectory:**
-   **UI/UX Responsiveness:** Enhanced display across mobile and tablet devices.
-   **Sentry Error Tracking:** Integrated for real-time error monitoring.
-   **Testing Suite:** Established unit (Jest) and E2E (Playwright) testing.
-   **CI/CD Pipeline:** Automated testing and deployment using GitHub Actions.
-   **Performance, Accessibility (WCAG), Security (OWASP) Audits:** Conducted and corresponding improvements implemented.
-   **Analytics Integration:** Google Analytics and Mixpanel integrated with tracking.
-   **Admin Panel:** A secure interface was built to manage users, products, orders, projects, and blogs.
    -   **Admin Order Annulment:** Functionality to cancel orders.
    -   **Admin Product Inventory:** Product management with SKU tracking.
    -   **Enhanced Product Fields:** Support for cover images, image galleries (2-5 images), rich text descriptions, SKUs, prices, min/max quantities, backorder status, inventory amount, and customizable variants (color, material, size).
    -   **Additional Product Attributes:** Fields for weight, dimensions (for Econt integration), SEO (title, description, URL slug), product categories/tags, visibility, featured status, stock alert thresholds, related products, and product badges.
    -   **B2B Features:** Included MOQ, bulk pricing tiers, lead time, and custom fields.
    -   **Admin Order Details:** Display product SKUs and detailed information within orders.
    -   **Order Status Management:** Admins can update order statuses.
    -   **Accurate Admin Statistics:** Dashboard statistics (e.g., total income) now exclude annulled, cancelled, and pending orders.
-   **Backorder System:** Products on backorder are displayed as such (not out of stock) on the shop page, and clients can request orders for them.
-   **Shop Filtering System:** Implemented category-based filtering and a price limiter.
-   **UI/UX Fixes:** Addressed and resolved:
    -   Escaped quotes in JSX leading to compilation errors.
    -   Price display bugs on shop and product detail pages.
    -   Hydration errors (text mismatch between server and client render).
    -   Cookie banner UI/UX (size, responsiveness) and its overlap with the Sentry Report a Bug widget.
    -   Empty state display for the cart page.
</product_requirements>

<key_technical_concepts>
-   **Frontend:** Next.js, React (TypeScript), Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui.
-   **Backend/APIs:** Next.js API routes, MongoDB.
-   **State/Context:** React Context (SimpleCartContext).
-   **Error Tracking:** Sentry.
-   **Testing:** Jest, Playwright.
-   **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions.
-   **Security:** , Zod (validation), .
-   **Analytics:** Google Analytics 4, Mixpanel.

<code_architecture>
The application employs a Next.js full-stack architecture, leveraging file-system-based routing for both frontend pages and backend API endpoints. MongoDB serves as the persistent data store. While the  e-commerce backend is part of the codebase, it remains inactive, leading to the use of a -based  for the storefront's cart functionality.


</code_architecture>

<pending_tasks>
-   Card processor integration.
-   Shipping provider integration (Econt).
-   Returns management system.
-   Scheduled Database Backups.
-   Disaster Recovery Procedure.
-   Adding the full product catalog (beyond the current test products).
-   Implement bulk product upload (CSV import).
-   Implement image upload functionality (instead of just URLs) for products.
-   Complete product variants UI/logic (backend fields are ready).
-   Manual E2E testing of the website for unwanted behavior, missing features, and bugs.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was focused on preparing the application for pre-release. This involved updating all existing documentation and creating new documentation files. Specifically, the AI successfully created  and updated . The most recently completed task was fixing a UI overlap issue where Sentry's Report a Bug widget was obstructing the cookie banner on desktop and tablet views; this was resolved by adjusting CSS in  to manage  and positioning. The very last action recorded was an attempt to update the  and create a comprehensive deployment guide, which failed due to a  tool error related to a missing or invalid path argument. The Medusa backend, PostgreSQL, and Redis remain disabled, with the application relying on a -based cart for storefront e-commerce.

<optional_next_step>
Fix the  tool usage error and successfully update  and create the deployment guide.
