## Common Misconceptions

### Myth 1: "PostgreSQL has paid tiers"
**FALSE.** PostgreSQL is always free. Managed hosting services have paid tiers, but the database itself is free.

### Myth 2: "Medusa charges per transaction"
**FALSE.** Medusa never charges transaction fees. Payment processors (Stripe) do, but that's separate.

### Myth 3: "Need Medusa Cloud subscription"
**FALSE.** Medusa Cloud is optional managed hosting. You're self-hosting for free.

### Myth 4: "Free tier has limits"
**FALSE.** Self-hosted PostgreSQL and Medusa have NO limits (except your server resources).
