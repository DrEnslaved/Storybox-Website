# Medusa vs Strapi - Which Do You Need?

## Your Current Setup

**Right now you have:**
```
Next.js Frontend
├── Medusa (E-commerce) ✅
│   ├── Products
│   ├── Cart
│   ├── Checkout
│   └── Orders
│
└── Sanity (CMS) ✅
    ├── Blog posts
    └── Content pages
```

**This is a GOOD setup!** You have:
- Medusa handling commerce
- Sanity handling content

---

## Options & Recommendations

### Option 1: Keep Current Setup (RECOMMENDED ✅)
```
Medusa (commerce) + Sanity (content)
```

**Pros:**
- Already working
- Sanity is excellent for content
- No migration needed
- Both systems integrated

**Cons:**
- None really

**Recommendation:** Stick with this unless you have specific reasons to change.

---

### Option 2: Replace Sanity with Strapi
```
Medusa (commerce) + Strapi (content)
```

**When to choose this:**
- You prefer Strapi's interface
- Need specific Strapi features
- Team already knows Strapi
- Want self-hosted CMS

**Effort Required:**
- Migrate blog posts from Sanity → Strapi
- Update API endpoints in Next.js
- Set up Strapi server
- 3-5 days of work

**Result:** Same functionality, different CMS

---

### Option 3: Use ONLY Strapi (NOT RECOMMENDED ❌)
```
Strapi for everything (commerce + content)
```

**Why NOT recommended:**
- Strapi is NOT built for e-commerce
- You'd lose Medusa's commerce features:
  - No proper cart management
  - No checkout flow
  - No payment processing
  - No order management
  - No shipping integration
  - No inventory tracking
- You'd need to build all commerce features from scratch
- Medusa is purpose-built for commerce
- Would take weeks/months to replicate

**Only choose this if:**
- You DON'T need e-commerce at all
- You're just displaying products (catalog only)
- No shopping cart or checkout needed

---

## Common Confusion Explained

### "Can Strapi handle products?"
**Technically yes, but...**
- Strapi can store product data (like a database)
- But Strapi CANNOT:
  - Manage shopping carts
  - Process payments
  - Handle checkout
  - Track orders
  - Manage shipping
  - Calculate taxes
  - Handle inventory
  - Process refunds

### "What's the difference between Medusa and Strapi products?"

**Medusa Products:**
```javascript
{
  id: "prod_123",
  title: "Bulgarian Shirt",
  variants: [/* S, M, L, XL */],
  inventory: { tracked: true, quantity: 50 },
  prices: [/* per region */],
  shipping_profile: { /* weight, dimensions */ },
  // Plus: cart integration, checkout flow, etc.
}
```

**Strapi Products (just data):**
```javascript
{
  id: 1,
  title: "Bulgarian Shirt",
  description: "...",
  image: "url",
  // That's it - no commerce features
}
```

## Real-World Analogy

Think of it like a restaurant:

**Medusa = Cash Register + Kitchen**
- Takes orders
- Processes payments
- Manages inventory
- Handles fulfillment

**Strapi/Sanity = Menu Board + Marketing Materials**
- Shows what's available
- Tells the story
- Marketing content
- Beautiful presentation

You need BOTH to run a restaurant!

## When You ONLY Need Strapi

Choose Strapi alone (no Medusa) ONLY if:

1. **No E-commerce:**
   - Just a blog
   - Portfolio site
   - Marketing website
   - News site

2. **Catalog Only:**
   - Show products but no buying
   - "Contact us for pricing"
   - Lead generation (not transactions)

3. **External E-commerce:**
   - Using Shopify for e-commerce
   - Products handled elsewhere

---

## When You NEED Medusa

You NEED Medusa if:

- ✅ Customers can add to cart
- ✅ Customers can checkout
- ✅ You process payments online
- ✅ You manage inventory
- ✅ You ship products
- ✅ Customers have order history
- ✅ You need a shopping cart

**You have all these features now with Medusa!**

---

## My Recommendation

### Keep Your Current Setup: Medusa + Sanity ✅

**Reasons:**
1. **It's working** - Cart, checkout, orders all functional
2. **Sanity is great** - One of the best headless CMS options
3. **No migration needed** - Save time and effort
4. **Best of both worlds** - Purpose-built tools for each job

### If You Really Want Strapi

You can have **both Medusa AND Strapi**:

```
Next.js Frontend
├── Medusa (E-commerce) - Keep this!
└── Strapi (Replace Sanity) - If you prefer it
```

**Steps:**
1. Keep Medusa (don't touch it)
2. Set up Strapi
3. Migrate blog from Sanity → Strapi
4. Update blog pages to fetch from Strapi
5. Remove Sanity

**Effort:** 3-5 days
**Benefit:** Use Strapi instead of Sanity (but Medusa stays)
